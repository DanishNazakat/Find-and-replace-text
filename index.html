            <p id="paragraph">The New Yorker magazine doesn't allow the phrase "World War II. " They say it should
            be "the Second World War." So let's search the following sentence for the banned characters
            and replace them with the phrase that the New Yorker prefers.

            myth, the essential notion that the good gray wizard can understand the evil magi precisely

            grasp his.</p>
